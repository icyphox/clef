> redis like key-value store, written in Nim

Requires the user to connect over telnet, at the moment. Will write a client for it later.

## Commands
- `set <key> <value>`
- `get <key>`
- `flush`
- `quit`

## TODO

- [ ] handle clients asynchronously
- [ ] a dedicated client
- [ ] cleanup code
- [ ] more features (?)
